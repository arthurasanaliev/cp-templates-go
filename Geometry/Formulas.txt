Cross Product: 
    Double area with (0,0)
    - Sign -> on Left
    + Sign -> on Right
    P * Q = P.x * Q.y - Q.x * P.y

Shoelace Formula: 
    Area of polygon
    A = Sum(Pi * Pi+1) for i = 1..N

Pick's Theorem:
    Number of lattice points
    A = i + b / 2 - 1
    b = Sum(gcd(dxi, dyi)) for i = 1..N
    i -> lattice points inside polygon
    b -> lattice points on boundary

Ray Casting:
    Check if point inside polygon
    Odd no of inters -> inside
    Even no of inters -> outside
